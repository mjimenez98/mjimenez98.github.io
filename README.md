## Creating this site

If you are looking into starting your own website and use it as a portfolio, blog or anything really, check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

If you do not know how to start, check out this [video walkthrough](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) by Giraffe Academy (recommended by Jekyll).
