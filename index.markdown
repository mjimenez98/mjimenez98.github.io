about: |
    Junior Computer Science Student at Concordia University. I have interned at [GitHub](https://github.com) and the 
    Montreal start-up [E-Panneur](https://e-panneur.ca) as a Rails web developer. I have developed a special relationship 
    with REST, APIs and building and coming up with exciting ideas. I like to think this software development path started 
    when my godfather gave me a PlayStation 2 🎮 when I was 5. Since then, I have not stopped playing video games, which 
    led me to create and think of spin-offs and mods I could write. And to be able to do that I needed to know how to 
    code, so here I am 🙋‍♂️️.

    Besides coding and video games, music, movies, hiking, traveling and soccer are my jam. Check out my
    [music collection]() and [travel journals]()!
