about: |
  Senior Computer Science Student at Concordia University. I have interned twice at [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} and once at the Montreal start-up [E-Panneur](https://e-panneur.ca){:target="_blank"} as a Rails web developer. 
  I have developed a special relationship with REST, APIs and building and coming up with exciting ideas. I like to think this software development path started when my godfather gave me a PlayStation 2 🎮 when I was 5. Since then, I have not stopped playing video games, which led me to create and think of spin-offs and mods I could write. And to be able to do that I needed to know how to code, so here I am 🙋‍♂️️. 
  > 
  Besides coding and video games, music, movies, traveling and soccer are my jam.
