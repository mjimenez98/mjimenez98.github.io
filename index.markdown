about: |
  Junior Computer Science Student at Concordia University. I have interned at [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} 
  and the Montreal start-up [E-Panneur](https://e-panneur.ca){:target="_blank"} as a Rails web developer. 
  I have developed a special relationship with REST, APIs and building and coming up with exciting ideas. I like to 
  think this software development path started when my godfather gave me a PlayStation 2 🎮 when I was 5. Since then, 
  I have not stopped playing video games, which led me to create and think of spin-offs and mods I could write. 
  And to be able to do that I needed to know how to code, so here I am 🙋‍♂️️.

  Besides coding and video games, music, movies, hiking, traveling and soccer are my jam. Check out my
  [music collection]() and [travel journals]()!
